1. the planning phase is the most intensive but the most crucial, especially prd, arch and ux. Use pro but never mcp
2. always create mockups as it'll help ai to design easily
3. you can create the sprint planning and strictly follow it till project, db and devops setup, after that we can vibe code using the epics and stories within them, saves a lot of time
4. the landing page can be created from inspirations
5. the copy can be created with better ai models using the prd, brief, market_reseacrch, brainstorm and docs
6. for assets and logos use nano banana, edit it, create a light and dark versions 
using realfavicons [https://realfavicongenerator.net/favicon-generator/nextjs/your-favicon-is-ready]
remove bg [https://www.remove.bg/]
favicons.io [https://favicon.io/favicon-converter/] to create awesome favicons
7. develop logging functionality as it'll help you catch and solve bugs very early
8. ask ai to write wikis for you for repated tasks like logging, timezone handling etc.
9. write tests but run it manually, dont let ai run it
10. use supabase cli as it'll drop a lot of brainload
11. save in memory to use the ux-spec and running npx tsc --noEmit after each run
12. keep docs and wiki up to date, mostly as the last task of each ai sessions
13. use images and gifs for more clarifications. remember your ai doesnot have eyes yet (you can add eyes by playwright)
14. bro commit even after one satisfaction, never git restore, please
15. bro keep both pro and flash, one as a senior and one as a junior helper
16. do the landing page in the last as you can generate good visually from real components from your app, so real and cool
17. I had added a cond in pointer that it must be diabled for touch screens so i had a pad but connected to kb so the pointer wasnt available, gemini was able to catch it
18. Give beutification tasks to higher model
19. refine epics and make wikis, you are good to go with adhoc dev/ course corrections
20. ask your model to read wikis while implementing
21. ask to model to always give you a summary of "I have successfully completed all tasks:" so you can keep track and also use it as a git commit message.
