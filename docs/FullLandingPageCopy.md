# Full Landing Page Copy for whatcha-doin

## Hero Section

**"So... whatcha doin'?"**

The app that helps you become the person you keep imagining --- by
stacking **Identity × Discipline × Consistency**, one tiny action at a
time.

Inspired by the iconic Phineas & Ferb question that always expects
greatness.

> "Small actions, done consistently, turn ambition into identity."

**CTA:** Start Your Identity Run

## Problem Section

**Ambition isn't your problem --- your system is.**

You're not unmotivated. You're just stuck in the "ambitious
underachiever" loop:

-   Big goals → overwhelming\
-   One broken streak → vibe gone\
-   Too many apps → no emotional connection\
-   Waiting for the perfect moment → never starts

whatcha-doin resets the whole game by helping you build identity, not
pressure.

> "Identity drives habits. Habits drive identity. We make the loop work
> for you."

## Backstory Section

**Born from an iconic question.**

Every episode, Isabella walks up with that curious smile and asks:\
**"Whatcha doin'?"**

Phineas always had an answer --- not because he was perfect but because
he always had *something* cooking.

whatcha-doin captures that same spark: curious, creative, always
building --- even if it's tiny.

> "Your life is a series. Your habits are the episodes. Your identity is
> the arc."

## Before / After Section

**Your identity shift starts small.**

### Before

-   Overthinking → no action\
-   Streak breaks → momentum gone\
-   Big goals → burnout\
-   Productivity apps → too complex

### After

-   Tiny habits → daily identity XP\
-   Two-Day Rule → consistency made human\
-   Action chips → calm visual clarity\
-   Journaling → auto-documented growth

You go from "trying to be disciplined" to *being* a disciplined person.
