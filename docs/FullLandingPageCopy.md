## Hero Section

**"So... whatcha doin?"**
Become the person you always kept imagining!

This app stacks up **Identity × Discipline × Consistency**, one habit at a time.

Inspired by the iconic Phineas & Ferb question that always expects greatness.

> "Small actions, done consistently, with discipline, turn ambitions into identity."

**CTA:** Start Building Your Identity

## Problem Section
**For the Lazy Ambitious Underachiver**
because ambitions isn't your problem - your system routine is.
You're not unmotivated nor lazy. You just lack discipline and a clear path. You're just stuck in the loop:
-   Big goals → overwhelming
-   One broken streak → vibe gone
-   Too many distractions → no emotional connection
-   Waiting for the sweet perfect moment → it never starts.

whatcha-do.in resets the whole game by helping you build **identity** with _discipline_ and _consistency_.

> "Identity drives habits. Habits drive identity. We make the loop work for you."

**CTA:** Redefine Yourself

## Backstory Section

**Born from an iconic question.**

Every episode, Isabella walks up with that curious smile and asks:
**"Whatcha doin'?"**

Phineas always had an answer, not because he was perfect but because
he always had *something* cooking.

whatcha-do.in captures that same spark: curious, creative, always
building, even if it's tiny.

> "Your life is a series. Your habits are the episodes. Your identity is
> the arc."

## Before / After Section

**Your identity shift starts small.**

### Before

-   Overthinking → no action
-   Streak breaks → momentum gone
-   Big goals → burnout
-   Productivity apps → too complex

### After

-   Tiny habits → daily identity XP
-   Two-Day Rule → consistency made human
-   Action chips → calm visual clarity
-   Journaling → auto-documented growth

You go from "trying to be disciplined" to *being* a disciplined person.

## Science & Features Section

**Your identity-building toolkit.**

### Two-Day Rule
Miss one day? Cool. Miss two? Streak resets --- sustainably.
**The Science:** The Two-Day Rule is a powerful psychological hack that prevents the 'all-or-nothing' mindset. It allows for a day of rest or imperfection without breaking the chain of consistency, which is crucial for long-term habit formation.

### Action Chips
Drag. Drop. Done. Brain-friendly productivity.
**The Science:** Action Chips turn tasks into tangible objects, reducing the cognitive load of decision-making. This visual, direct-manipulation interface makes it easier to start and complete tasks.

### Intensity Slider
100% and 20% both count. Effort matters.
**The Science:** The Intensity Slider acknowledges that effort is not always 100%. By tracking effort, you reinforce your identity as 'someone who does the thing,' even on low-energy days. This is a core tenet of identity-based habits.

### Auto-Journal Feed
Your growth, captured seamlessly.
**The Science:** Journaling is a powerful tool for self-awareness, but it's often a habit in itself. By automating the process, we lower the barrier to entry, making it easy to see your progress and connect the dots over time.

### Public Profile
Your "Life Resume" — streaks, habits, reflections.
**The Science:** Sharing your progress can be a powerful motivator. Your public profile acts as a 'life resume,' showcasing your dedication and consistency. It's not about comparing yourself to others, but about being accountable to your own goals.

### Identity Anchoring
You align each habit with the identity you want.
**The Science:** True behavior change is identity change. By anchoring your habits to a desired identity (e.g., 'I am a writer' instead of 'I want to write'), you create a powerful feedback loop that reinforces your new self-image.

## CTA Section

**It's build-your-identity o'clock.**

You've imagined the best version of you long enough.
Here's the simplest way to start --- today, in the tiniest way.

Identity is built daily.
Today is ready when you are.

**CTA:** Start Building Your Identity

> "A year from now, they'll ask how you did it.
> You'll say: 'I just didn't miss two days.'"
