# User Project Description: Yes it's called whatcha-do.in (short for what are you doing?). I have a principle that your identity is actually what you are doing consistently today. A persons identity is his actions that he takes. Miss an act one day, it's a question he asks is he really serious about the goal. 2 day miss is his answer no. 2+ days miss he answered never and he should start all over again. So I want to develop a pure brwoser based frontend js app depicting this idea. Let's dicuss further
