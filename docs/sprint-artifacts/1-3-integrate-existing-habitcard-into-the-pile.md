## Dev Agent Record
- **Context Reference:** `docs/sprint-artifacts/stories/1-3-integrate-existing-habitcard-into-the-pile.context.xml`

## 1. Story Description

As a user, I want to see a sample habit card displayed within "The Pile" column on my dashboard, so that I can visualize how my habits will appear and confirm the basic integration of habit components.

## 2. Requirements and Context

### 2.1. Requirements Summary

This story requires integrating the existing `HabitCard.tsx` component into the "The Pile" section of the foundational dashboard layout created in story 1.2. The card should be populated with static/dummy data to serve as a visual placeholder and validate the component integration. This is a critical step in the "Foundational UI First" strategy.

### 2.2. System Architecture Alignment

This story aligns with the **Hybrid Code Organization** defined in the architecture, specifically placing a feature-specific component (`HabitCard`) within a larger layout (`DashboardLayout`). It leverages the established `components/` directory structure. No backend or API interaction is required for this story.

### 2.3. Lessons from Previous Story

Previous story not yet implemented.

## 3. Acceptance Criteria

| ID | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| AC-1 | **Given** the foundational dashboard layout from story 1.2 is present, **when** the user navigates to the `/dashboard` route, **then** at least one `HabitCard` component is rendered inside the element designated as "The Pile". |
| AC-2 | The integrated `HabitCard` must be populated with static (dummy) data for display purposes. |
| AC-3 | The `HabitCard` must be styled correctly and appear visually integrated within the layout without breaking the parent container's styles. |
| AC-4 | The application must run without errors via `pnpm dev`, and the integrated `HabitCard` must be visible on the rendered page. |

## 4. Technical Implementation Tasks

| Task | Description | Story Points |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Task 4.1: Import and Render `HabitCard`** | Import the `HabitCard.tsx` component into the `DashboardLayout.tsx` or its relevant child component for "The Pile". | 1 |
| **Task 4.2: Provide Static Data** | Create a static/dummy habit object and pass it as props to the `HabitCard` component. | 1 |
| **Task 4.3: Verify Styling and Layout** | Manually test and verify that the `HabitCard` component's styles do not conflict with the dashboard layout and that it is correctly contained within "The Pile". | 1 |
| **Task 4.4: E2E Test** | Create a Playwright test to verify that the `HabitCard` component is rendered within the correct section of the dashboard page. | 2 |

## 5. Developer Notes

- This story is a direct implementation of the "Initial Integration of Epic 2 Components" task outlined in the PRD's revised development strategy.
- The primary focus is on **visual integration**, not functionality. The `HabitCard` does not need to be interactive at this stage.
- If the existing `HabitCard.tsx` requires minor refactoring to be integrated (e.g., prop changes, style adjustments), that work is within the scope of this story.
