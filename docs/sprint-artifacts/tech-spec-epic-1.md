Epic ID: 1
Status: Draft

---

## Overview

This technical specification details the foundational epic (Epic-1) of the "whatcha-do.in" application, focusing on the core systems for user and profile management, recurring habit tracking, and one-off todo management. This epic lays the groundwork for an intuitive, keyboard-first experience aimed at empowering users to build and maintain positive routines. It encompasses the essential features that enable users to manage their daily tasks and habits, which are central to the application's vision of fostering personal growth and consistency through robust habit and todo management.

## Objectives and Scope

**In-Scope:**
*   **User & Profile Management (FR-1):** Implementation of user accounts with Magic Link authentication, user bio editing, and configuration of unique public IDs (slugs) for public profiles, displaying public habits, todos, and journal.
*   **Core Habit Management (FR-2):** Functionality for creating, editing, and deleting recurring habits, including public/private toggles, visible streak counters, quantitative goals with unit selection, and the ability to adjust goals without breaking streaks. Support for both broad and atomic habits.
*   **Core Todo Management (FR-3):** Implementation of one-off todo creation with an intelligent notepad concept, 2-level sub-todos, public/private toggles, and completion/deletion functionality.
*   **Main Interface & Core Logic (FR-4.1 - FR-4.10):** Development of the three-column habit layout ("Today", "Yesterday", "The Pile") with responsive interactions (drag-and-drop for desktop, tap-to-move for mobile), precise sorting rules, and the core logic governing daily state changes, the Grace Period, and the "Two-Day Rule" (Lively and Junked states, including the Junked Days Counter). This also includes the ability to undo habit completion.
*   **General UI & UX (FR-6.3, FR-6.4, FR-7.1):** Development of the application as a Single Page Application (SPA), inclusion of a prominent theme switcher, and the "Positive Urgency UI" for the 'Yesterday' column.

**Out-of-Scope (for Epic 1):**
*   Journaling System (FR-5, except as it pertains to logging completion details)
*   Motivational Quote Widget (FR-6.1)
*   Core Keyboard Shortcuts (FR-6.2)
*   Teleport-to-Journal Animation (FR-7.2)
*   Advanced Profiles or Data Visualizations (Growth Features)

## System Architecture Alignment

The implementation of Epic-1 will align with the established system architecture, leveraging Next.js for the frontend, Supabase for backend services (PostgreSQL, Authentication, Realtime), and Vercel for deployment. Core logic related to habit state changes, such as the Grace Period and the "Two-Day Rule", will utilize a hybrid approach combining client-side triggers with Supabase Database Functions to ensure data integrity and real-time accuracy. Data modeling will incorporate the extended `habits` table and the new `habit_completions` table to support quantitative goals and detailed completion logging. Row Level Security (RLS) will be fundamental in enforcing the separation of public and private user data, particularly for habits and todos. The project structure will follow the Next.js App Router conventions, with dedicated modules for authentication, habit management, and todo features, ensuring clear separation of concerns and maintainability.

### APIs and Interfaces

The primary API will be Supabase's auto-generated PostgREST API, providing RESTful access to the defined data models. Custom logic not covered by PostgREST will be exposed via Supabase Database Functions (PostgreSQL functions), which can be invoked directly from the client. All API interactions will adhere to a consistent JSON response format, returning data under a `data` key for success and an `error` object (with `message`, `code`, `details`) for failures.

**User & Profile Management APIs:**
*   `POST /auth/v1/magiclink`: Initiate Magic Link login (Supabase Auth).
*   `GET /{username}`: Retrieve public profile data.
*   `PUT /users/{user_id}`: Update user bio and `username`.
*   `public.check_username_uniqueness(p_username, text)`: Supabase DB Function to validate `username` uniqueness.

**Habit Management APIs:**
*   `GET /habits`: Retrieve all user habits.
*   `POST /habits`: Create a new habit.
*   `PUT /habits/{habit_id}`: Update habit details (name, public/private status, goal).
*   `DELETE /habits/{habit_id}`: Delete a habit (restricted to "The Pile" state via RLS/function).
*   `POST /habit_completions`: Record a habit completion with mood, work, duration, notes.
*   `POST /rpc/undo_habit_completion`: Supabase Function to undo habit completion and update streak.
*   `POST /rpc/process_grace_period`: Supabase Function to handle grace period logic and state changes.
*   `POST /rpc/enforce_two_day_rule`: Supabase Function to manage "Two-Day Rule" state transitions (`Lively`, `Junked`).

**Todo Management APIs:**
*   `GET /todos`: Retrieve all user todos.
*   `POST /todos`: Create a new todo (potentially with `parent_todo_id`).
*   `PUT /todos/{todo_id}`: Update todo description, public/private status, completion status.
*   `DELETE /todos/{todo_id}`: Delete a todo.

### Workflows and Sequencing

1.  **User Account Creation & Profile Setup:**
    *   User initiates Magic Link login (client calls Supabase Auth).
    *   Upon successful authentication, `user_id` is established.
    *   User configures `username` and `bio` via UI.
    *   Client calls `check_username_uniqueness` (Supabase DB Function) to validate `username`.
    *   Client calls `PUT /users/{user_id}` to update profile.

2.  **Habit Creation:**
    *   User types habit name in "The Pile" UI.
    *   User optionally clicks `+ Add Goal`, inputs `goal_value` and `goal_unit`.
    *   Client calls `POST /habits` to create new habit.

3.  **Habit Completion:**
    *   User moves habit to "Today" column (client-side UI update).
    *   Completion modal triggers (client-side).
    *   User inputs `mood_score`, `work_value`, `duration`, `notes`.
    *   Client calls `POST /habit_completions` to record completion.
    *   Client updates habit's `current_streak`, `last_recorded_mood`, `last_recorded_work_value`, `last_recorded_work_unit` via `PUT /habits/{habit_id}`.

4.  **Daily State Change & Grace Period (Client-Side Triggered, Server-Side Logic):**
    *   At 12:00 AM local time, on app open, client checks `grace_screen_shown_for_date`.
    *   If `grace_screen_shown_for_date` is before current date and pending habits exist from yesterday:
        *   Client displays Grace Period screen.
        *   User interacts with Grace Period (marks habits complete for yesterday).
        *   Client calls `POST /rpc/process_grace_period` (Supabase Function) with user's actions.
    *   Regardless of Grace Period, the client (or a scheduled Supabase Function) calls `POST /rpc/enforce_two_day_rule` to manage `Lively` and `Junked` states for habits in "The Pile".

5.  **"Two-Day Rule" Enforcement (Supabase Function `enforce_two_day_rule`):**
    *   Identifies habits in "Yesterday" not completed.
    *   Moves them to "The Pile" and sets `pile_state = 'Lively'`.
    *   After 24 hours in 'Lively' state, transitions to `pile_state = 'Junked'`, resets `current_streak`, and sets `last_streak`.

6.  **Undo Habit Completion:**
    *   User long-presses a habit in "Today" (client-side).
    *   Client calls `POST /rpc/undo_habit_completion` (Supabase Function).
    *   Function reverts `current_streak`, moves habit back to "Yesterday" or "The Pile" based on original state.

7.  **Todo Management:**
    *   User creates/edits/completes/deletes todos via UI.
    *   Client calls `GET`, `POST`, `PUT`, `DELETE` operations on `/todos` endpoint.

## Non-Functional Requirements

### Performance

*   **Public Profile Load Time (NFR-1.1):** Public profile pages will achieve fast load times, especially on mobile and in-app browsers, through Next.js's SSR/SSG capabilities, image optimization, code splitting, lazy loading, and Vercel's CDN caching and edge deployments.
*   **Real-time Data Synchronization (NFR-1.2):** The real-time data synchronization will be efficient with low latency, utilizing Supabase Realtime and optimized database queries, ensuring it does not degrade overall application performance. Client-side caching and optimistic UI updates will enhance perceived performance.

### Security

*   **Authentication (NFR-2.1):** Supabase Auth will securely implement Magic Link authentication, ensuring single-use tokens with short expiry times.
*   **Authorization (NFR-2.2):** Strict separation of public and private data will be enforced using PostgreSQL Row Level Security (RLS) at the database level, preventing unauthorized access and data leakage.
*   **Data Encryption:** Data at rest in Supabase PostgreSQL will be encrypted, and data in transit will be secured with TLS/SSL.
*   **API Security:** Supabase's PostgREST API will be secured via JWTs issued by Supabase Auth.
*   **Server-Side Validation:** Critical business logic within Supabase Database Functions will prevent client-side manipulation and maintain data integrity.
*   **Public ID Security:** Reserved system slugs will be enforced to prevent routing conflicts.

### Reliability/Availability

The application will leverage the inherent reliability of managed services like Supabase (PostgreSQL, Auth, Realtime) and Vercel (deployment). Supabase Database Functions will enforce critical business rules server-side, contributing to data integrity and consistent application behavior. The architecture is designed for high availability through these cloud-native platforms.

### Observability

*   **Error Reporting:** Frontend errors will be captured by Sentry, while backend errors will be logged in Supabase. Critical alerts will be forwarded to a Lark chat webhook.
*   **Structured Logging:** Structured logging with standard levels (DEBUG, INFO, WARN, ERROR, FATAL) will be implemented across the application to ensure maintainability, debuggability, and centralized visibility of application health.

| 38   | The 'Yesterday' column features an "Ambient Animated Background" with a slow, shifting gradient, and a tooltip on hover displays time remaining.                                                                 | FR-7.1, `ux-design-specification.md` | `app/(main)/me/page.tsx` (Yesterday column component), CSS animations                                                                 | UI: Verify animated background and tooltip on hover in 'Yesterday' column.                              |

## Risks, Assumptions, Open Questions

**Risks:**
*   **Complexity of Novel UX Patterns:** Implementing features like the "Positive Urgency UI" and the nuances of the "Two-Day Rule" and "Grace Period" logic, especially across client-side and Supabase Database Functions, may introduce unexpected complexity and bugs.
*   **Performance Bottlenecks with Supabase:** While Supabase is scalable, inefficient database queries or excessive real-time subscriptions could lead to performance issues, particularly for "The Pile" column with complex sorting logic or public profiles with high traffic.
*   **Security Vulnerabilities in RLS:** Incorrectly configured Row Level Security policies could lead to unauthorized data access, despite the robust nature of RLS. Thorough testing is critical.
*   **Client-Side Timezone Dependence:** Relying on client-side timezones for initiating daily state changes and Grace Period could lead to inconsistencies if not handled robustly, especially with users changing timezones or manipulating client-side clocks.
*   **Reserved Slugs Conflicts:** Ensuring comprehensive prevention of `username` conflicts with system routes (e.g., `/auth`, `/me`) requires careful management to avoid routing issues.

**Assumptions:**
*   **Supabase Free Tier Scalability:** The current Supabase free tier will be sufficient for MVP development and initial user load.
*   **Next.js App Router Maturity:** The Next.js App Router is sufficiently mature and stable for building complex SPAs, and its conventions will streamline development.
*   **Shadcn/UI & Aceternity UI Integration:** Integration of `shadcn/ui` and `Aceternity UI` will be straightforward and provide the desired aesthetic and functionality without significant customization effort.
*   **User Timezone Consistency:** Users will either not frequently change their device's timezone or the application will handle such changes gracefully without data inconsistencies.
*   **API Rate Limits:** Supabase API rate limits will be adequate for the planned usage patterns within this epic.

**Open Questions:**
*   How will the "Intelligent Notepad" for Todos (FR-3.1) handle rich text formatting or markdown? (Currently assumed plain text).
*   What is the specific behavior and UI for adding a new or existing habit to the previous day's record within the "Grace Period" screen (FR-4.4.2)?
*   Are there any specific accessibility requirements beyond WCAG 2.1 Level AA for keyboard navigation for specific components?
*   How will `goal_at_completion` be used for historical analysis or reporting? (Beyond current storage).
*   What is the error handling strategy for Supabase Database Functions specifically for user-facing errors vs. internal logging?

## Test Strategy Summary

The test strategy for Epic-1 will focus on ensuring the stability and correctness of core functional requirements and critical data flows, aligning with the pragmatic MVP approach.

*   **Unit Tests (Vitest & React Testing Library):**
    *   **Scope:** Individual utility functions (e.g., date/time calculations, sorting logic), isolated React components (e.g., `HabitCard`, `HabitCreator`, `EditBioForm`).
    *   **Focus:** Verifying the correctness of algorithms, component rendering, and isolated state changes.
*   **Integration Tests (Vitest):**
    *   **Scope:** Interactions between frontend components and Supabase client, Supabase Database Functions in isolation, and data layer operations.
    *   **Focus:** Ensuring data is correctly persisted and retrieved, API contracts are met, and server-side logic (e.g., Two-Day Rule enforcement, Grace Period processing) behaves as expected.
*   **End-to-End (E2E) Tests (Playwright):**
    *   **Scope:** Critical user journeys, including user signup, login/logout, habit creation, habit completion, updating public profile, and navigating core UI sections.
    *   **Focus:** Validating that the entire application flow works seamlessly from a user's perspective, covering both happy paths and key error scenarios (e.g., invalid public ID). Special attention will be given to the "Grace Period" and "Two-Day Rule" transitions.
*   **CI/CD Integration:** All unit, integration, and E2E tests will be integrated into GitHub Actions to ensure automated validation on every code change.
*   **Manual Testing:** Extensive manual testing will be performed, particularly for the novel UX patterns (e.g., "Positive Urgency UI") and responsive layouts, which are difficult to fully automate.
