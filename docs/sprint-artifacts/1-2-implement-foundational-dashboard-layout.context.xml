  <constraints>
    <constraint>This story should only implement the layout with static placeholder content. No dynamic data or backend integration is required.</constraint>
    <constraint>The layout must be responsive, adhering to the two-row desktop and single-column mobile designs specified in the UX documentation.</constraint>
    <constraint>Styling should be implemented using Tailwind CSS, consistent with the project's architecture.</constraint>
  </constraints>
  <interfaces />
  <tests>
    <standards>The project follows a "Lean MVP" testing strategy using Vitest for unit tests and Playwright for E2E tests. Visual regression testing is recommended for layout-heavy stories like this one.</standards>

    <ideas>
      <idea for="AC-3">Create a Playwright E2E test that navigates to `/dashboard` and asserts that elements with test-ids for "bio", "todos", "today", "yesterday", and "the-pile" are all present.</idea>
      <idea for="AC-4, AC-5">Create a Playwright test that takes screenshots of the dashboard page at both desktop and mobile viewports. These can be used for visual regression testing.</idea>
      <idea for="AC-6">A simple Vitest/RTL unit test could be written for the placeholder components to ensure they render the correct static text.</idea>
