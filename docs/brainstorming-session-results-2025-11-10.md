# Brainstorming Session Results

## Executive Summary

**Topic:** A browser-based application to track daily actions and build identity based on consistency.

**Session Goals:** Develop a pure browser-based frontend JS app with a three-column layout (Today, Yesterday, Wasted) to manage and visualize daily actions (acts). Core mechanics include adding acts, automatic progression of acts from Today to Yesterday, manual dragging of acts to maintain streaks, and a 'wasted' state for missed acts.

### Insights and Learnings

_Key realizations from the session_

* **Refined Guiding Principle:** The core philosophy of the app was distilled into the powerful and memorable statement: "You are what you do. Consistently."

* **The Dual-Motivation Engine:** The app's core loop will be driven by a combination of reward and penalty.
    * **Reward (The Carrot):** A user's public profile will visually evolve and become more artistic as they maintain long streaks, creating a desirable goal.
    * **Penalty (The Stick):** The unforgiving "Two-Day Rule" where a streak is broken and the act moves to "The Pile" provides the necessary tension and stakes.

* **Philosophical & Scientific Validation:** The app's core premise is not a new invention but a rediscovery of a timeless truth, validated by:
    * **Ancient Philosophy:** Aristotle's concept that "We are what we repeatedly do."
    * **Modern Psychology:** The scientifically supported "Two-Day Rule" for habit formation.
    * **Popular Literature:** The principles of "identity-based habits" popularized by James Clear's "Atomic Habits."

* **Core Experience Decision:** The app is to be a "purely personal activity." Social features like groups or pacts are explicitly excluded to focus on the individual's journey.
