## Overview

This document provides the complete epic and story breakdown for whatcha-doin, decomposing the requirements from
the [PRD](./PRD.md) into implementable stories.

**CRITICAL ARCHITECTURAL DECISION:** The application will leverage **Supabase** for all data persistence from day one.
This includes PostgreSQL for data storage, Authentication for user management, and its auto-generated API. This
simplifies the architecture, eliminates future rework, and accelerates core feature development.

**Important Development Note:** To allow immediate access to the application during local development, a predefined user
session will be injected (see Epic 1, Story 1.2) to bypass the full authentication flow. This bypass will now mock a
Supabase session by directly interacting with Supabase tables using the hardcoded user's `user_id`, bypassing Supabase
Authentication for data operations. After successful authentication (or bypass), the user will be on their root-level
profile `/[username]`, which serves as the entry point for their entire private dashboard experience (e.g.,
`/[username]/habits`).

**Living Document Notice:** This is the initial version. It will be updated after UX Design and Architecture workflows
add interaction and technical details to stories.

Here's the proposed epic structure, designed to facilitate incremental and integrated development, ensuring visible
progress and continuous value delivery:

* **Epic 1: Core Application Foundation & Authenticated Root View**
  Goal: Establish the foundational project infrastructure, implement a development-friendly bypass for Supabase data
  interaction, and lay out the basic authenticated UI, which is the user's main dashboard located at `/[username]`.
    * **Scope:** Project setup, core infrastructure, development data interaction bypass (mocking Supabase Auth and
      directly using tables with a hardcoded user ID), the basic authenticated root view at `/[username]` (bio, todo,
      three-box sections), and initial setup for user authentication (FR-1.1, FR-1.2 for future, FR-1.3 for current).
    * **Sequencing:** This is the absolute first epic, providing the essential environment and core authenticated UI
      before any
      feature-specific development begins.
    * **System Architecture Alignment:** This epic directly implements the User Management and Authentication
      components, leveraging **Supabase Auth** for Magic Link functionality and **Supabase PostgreSQL** for storing user
      profile data in the `users` table. All security and data access will be governed by the **Row Level Security (RLS)
      ** policies and **JWT-based authentication**. Public profile pages will be **Server-Side Rendered (SSR)** or *
      *Static Site Generated (SSG)** Next.js pages for fast load times (NFR-1.1).
    * **Services and Modules:**
        * **Supabase Auth:** Handles user sign-up, logins (Magic Link), logout, and session management.
        * **User Profile Service** (`lib/supabase/user.ts`): Provides an abstraction layer for interacting with the
          `users` table.
        * **Auth UI Component** (`components/auth/Logins.tsx`): Renders the UI for email input and handles the call to
          Supabase Auth.
        * **Public Profile Page** (`app/[username]/page.tsx`): Fetches and displays a user's public profile information.
    * **Data Models and Contracts (`users` table schema):**
      ```sql
      CREATE TABLE public.users (
        id UUID PRIMARY KEY REFERENCES auth.users(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
        email VARCHAR(255) UNIQUE NOT NULL,
        username TEXT UNIQUE NOT NULL,
        bio TEXT,
        timezone VARCHAR(255),
        created_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW(),
        updated_at TIMESTAMPTZ
      );

      -- Enable Row Level Security
      ALTER TABLE public.users ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

      -- Policy: Users can view their own profile
      CREATE POLICY "Users can view their own profile"
      ON public.users FOR SELECT
      USING (auth.uid() = id);

      -- Policy: Users can update their own profile
      ON public.users FOR UPDATE
      USING (auth.uid() = id)
      WITH CHECK (auth.uid() = id);
      ```
    * **APIs and Interfaces (Key Supabase Client Interactions):**
        * `supabase.auth.signInWithOtp({ email })`: To initiate the Magic Link logins.
        * `supabase.auth.signOut()`: To log the user out.
        * `supabase.from('users').select('*').eq('id', userId).single()`: To fetch a user's profile.
        * `supabase.from('users').update({ bio: newBio }).eq('id', userId)`: To update a user's bio.
    * **Non-Functional Requirements:**
        * **Performance (NFR-1.1):** Public profile pages must achieve a fast load time, rendered using Next.js SSR or
          SSG.
        * **Security (NFR-2.1, NFR-2.2):** Magic Link tokens must be single-use and expire quickly. Strict RLS policies
          on the `users` table enforce data separation.
        * **Reliability/Availability:** Dependent on Supabase's uptime.
        * **Observability:** Auth-related errors logged in Supabase, client-side errors captured by Sentry, critical
          failures alert to Lark chat webhook.

### Story 1.0: Initial Database Schema Setup

As a developer,
I want to create and commit the initial database schema migrations for all core entities,
so that the database is ready for application development.

**Prerequisites:** None.

### Story 1.1: Project Setup and Core Infrastructure

As a developer,
I want the project to have a standardized setup with core dependencies, build system, and basic deployment pipeline,
So that all subsequent development can proceed efficiently and consistently.

**Prerequisites:** None.

### Story 1.2: Implement Development Login Bypass

As a developer,
I want to bypass the full Supabase login flow during local development,
So that I can quickly test core features using a predefined user session without repeated logins.

**Prerequisites:** Story 1.1.

### Story 1.3: Establish `username` in Database and Create Profile Page

As a developer,
I want to add a `username` column to the `users` table and create the basic page structure for the `/[username]` dynamic
route,
So that there is a foundation for the user's profile and main authenticated view.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

1. A new Supabase migration file is created that adds a `username` column to the `public.users` table.
2. The `username` column is of type `text` and has a `UNIQUE` constraint.
3. The migration is successfully applied to the database.
4. The `app/[username]/page.tsx` file is created.
5. When navigating to `/[username]` (e.g., `/hammaadworks`), the page renders without errors.

**Prerequisites:** Story 1.2 completed.

**Technical Notes:** This story is a foundational step to enable the `/[username]` routing pattern. The page itself can
be a simple placeholder for now. The migration should also update the existing test user with a default username.

### Story 1.4: Implement Default Username Generation at Signup

As a new user,
I want a default username to be automatically generated for me from my email address upon signup,
So that I have a valid profile URL from the start without extra steps.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

1. A Supabase Database Function is created that triggers on a new user insert into `auth.users`.
2. The function extracts the local part of the new user's email (before the '@').
3. It checks if the extracted username already exists in `public.users`.
4. If the username is unique, it is inserted into the `username` column for the new user.
5. If the username is not unique, a random 3-digit number is appended (e.g., `abc_198`), and this new username is
   inserted.
6. The function handles potential race conditions and ensures a unique username is always generated.

**Prerequisites:** Story 1.3 completed.

7. When a user navigates to `/[username]`, the system first checks if the username exists. If not, it displays the
   application's 404 Not Found page.

### Story 1.5: Implement Foundational Authenticated Main View Layout

As a user,
I want to see the basic layout of my private profile view at `/[username]`, including placeholders for my bio, todo
list, and the three
habit columns ("Today", "Yesterday", and "The Pile"),
So that I have a clear structure for where my habits and todos will appear.

**Prerequisites:** Story 1.3.

**Technical Notes:** This layout will be implemented within `app/[username]/page.tsx` and its corresponding layout file.

### Story 1.6: Integrate Existing HabitCard into "The Pile"

## Epic 3: Action Management

**Goal:** Enable users to create, manage, and complete hierarchical "Actions" with unlimited nesting, leveraging a
NoSQL-style JSONB data structure to support complex task breakdown and a unique "Next Day Clearing" lifecycle dependent
on user timezone.

### Story 3.1: Implement Timezone Management (Foundation)

As a user,
I want to be able to explicitly set my preferred timezone (or have it auto-detected),
So that all my "daily" logic (like Action clearing and Habit tracking) happens at the correct time for me, regardless of
my device or travel.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

1. Database migration to add `timezone` column to `users` table (if not already present).

## Epic 4: Journaling & Data Entry

**Goal:** Provide a comprehensive journaling system integrated with habit/action completion, allowing for detailed
logging and reflection, and enabling the "Next Day Clearing" of completed items from active lists by teleporting them to
the journal.

### Story 4.1: Implement Habit/Action Completion Modal Trigger

As a user,
I want a modal to appear when I mark a habit or action as complete,
So that I can record details about my completion which will eventually feed into my journal.

**Prerequisites:** Epic 2 (for habits), Epic 3 (for actions).

So that I can capture additional context about my completion for my journal entries.

**Prerequisites:** Story 4.1.

### Story 4.5: Implement Modal Bypass and Cancel

As a user,
I want to bypass detail entry or cancel the completion modal,
So that I can quickly log items or discard accidental completions without affecting my journal.

**Prerequisites:** Story 4.1.

### Story 4.6: Implement Modal Pre-fill for Re-records

As a user,
I want the completion modal to pre-fill with my last recorded values if I re-record a habit on the same day,
So that I don't have to re-enter the same information for my journal.

**Prerequisites:** Story 4.1, Story 2.12 (undo completion).

### Story 4.7: Implement "Next Day Clearing" Logic with Delete-on-Journal (Actions & Targets)

As a user,
I want completed actions and targets to be removed from my active lists and permanently saved to my journal on the next
day (in my local timezone),
So that my active lists stay clean and the journal serves as a permanent record.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

1. **Detection:** The system identifies actions/targets where `completed_at` is before "Start of Today" (User Timezone).
2. **Teleportation:** These identified items are formatted as text (e.g., `- [x] Description`) and appended to the
   `content` of the `journal_entries` row for their completion date.
3. **Deletion:** After successful journaling, the completed nodes are **permanently deleted** from the `actions` or
   `targets` JSONB tree in the database.
4. **Ghosting:** If a deleted action node has active children, the parent node is preserved in a "ghost" state (visible
   but cleared) to maintain the tree structure.
5. This logic correctly processes both actions and targets according to their respective lifecycles.

**Prerequisites:** Story 3.8 (Action Completion with Timestamps), Story 3.1 (Timezone Management), Story 9.5 (Targets
UI), and the `journal_entries` table schema.

### Story 4.8: Implement Teleport-to-Journal Animation

`(user_id, entry_date, is_public)`.

### Story 4.10: Implement Automatic Journaling for Completed Items

As a user,
I want notes from completed habits, actions, and targets to be automatically added to the correct tab (Public/Private)
of my Journal for the day they were completed,
So that my journal is automatically populated with a record of my progress.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

1. Notes from public items (habits, actions, targets) go to the Public Journal tab.
2. Notes from private items (habits, actions, targets) go to the Private Journal tab.
3. This applies to all types of completed items that are subject to "Next Day Clearing".

**Prerequisites:** Story 4.4, Story 4.7, Story 4.9.

### Story 4.11: Implement Free-Form Journal Entry

**Prerequisites:** Story 9.2, Epic 2 (Habits).

### Story 9.4: Implement Targets Schema (Monthly JSONB)

As a developer,
I want to create the `targets` table to store monthly target lists,
So that users can plan their month.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

1. **Rollover:** On app load, if the current month has changed, unfinished items from the *old* "Current Month" are
   moved to the *new* "Current Month" record.
2. **Clearing:** Completed targets follow the "Next Day Clearing" logic (defined in Epic 4): they are then deleted from
   the `targets` DB.

**Prerequisites:** Story 9.5, Epic 4 (for Next Day Clearing).

## Epic 8: Supabase Authentication Integration

**Goal:** Fully integrate Supabase's authentication system, replacing the development bypass with live Magic Link logins
and user management.
*   **Scope:** Transition from development bypass (Story 1.2) to full Supabase authentication flow (FR-1.1, FR-1.2),
including handling user sessions and authentication states across the application.
*   **Sequencing:** This is the *final epic* in the development sequence, occurring after all core features (Epics 1-7)
are completed and stable, marking the transition to a fully authenticated production-ready application.

### Story 8.1: Supabase Login and Logout

As a user,
I want to create an account, log in and out of the application using a Magic Link,
so that I can securely access and protect my session and user data.

**Prerequisites:** Epic 1-7 completed.
